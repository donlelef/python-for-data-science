# 1. Basic Polars
In this seminar, we will learn how to use Polars, a blazingly fast DataFrame library implemented in Rust and bound to Python using PyO3. 
We will cover the basics of Polars, such as creating DataFrames, filtering, and aggregating data, and joining DataFrames.

> In the `solution` directory, you will find the final project structure that we will create in this seminar.

## Installing Jupyter Lab
We will use Jupyter Lab to run the code in this seminar. To install Jupyter Lab, run the following command:
```shell
uv add jupyterlab
```
Then, start Jupyter Lab by running:
```shell
uv run jupyter lab
```

And now, let's open the notebook.
